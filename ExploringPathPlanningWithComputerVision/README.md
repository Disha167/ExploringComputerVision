It is a very basic introduction to some part of computer vision and image processing
It is a 10*10 grid of image containg obstacles and objects. 
We use the sliding window technique for sliding across the image and then add the obstacles as well as object to the list.
Then, we utilise the above list of objects for traversing the images and then use structural similarity index for checking which of  them is similar.
Then, A* search algorithm is used for finding the shortest path between the two similar objects.

Thanks to channel @sirajology for motivating me and @Aniruddha Tapas for the implementation related stuffs.
